normal:Blitz: I’ll have you know puppet-
normal:Blitz: There are only two things I know of that can leave my dear elder sibling in such an awful state...
normal:Blitz: First: Their emotions have been tampered with from the outside, and not even they can counter it. I doubt you're as controlling or even capable as our father, so that’s a no.
normal:Blitz: Second: They’ve had an epiphany. An epiphany so great that would leave a lesser being destroyed, and others like our dear Dari, breaking down...
normal:Blitz: Obviously, Sheol and I, as Darian’s younger siblings, are lesser beings.
normal:Blitz: Whatever Darian discovered, I’ll discover soon as well...
normal:Dari: No- wait- stop- You shoul-
normal:Blitz: It’s too late, dear. 
normal:Blitz: For every mistake, and I mean, EVERY mistake you make, you’ll bleed.
normal:Blitz: I know you can come back whenever you die, we can all tell that.
normal:Blitz: But there’s something else here too, and I’m willing to die to learn what broke my dear sibling.
