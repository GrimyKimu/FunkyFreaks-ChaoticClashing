normal:Darian: Let us sing a song together. 
normal:Darian: Sheol loves this song, it will soothe her fractured ego, and bury this axe.

normal:Sheol: Hmph! Whatever, Dari!! Don’t bother singing! It won’t do a thing!

normal:Sheol:  :I
normal:Darian: Now then, let us begin. And do not worry about lyrics, I am sure you can handle your way around gibberish, correct?
