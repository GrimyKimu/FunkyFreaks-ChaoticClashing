normal:Dari: Unfortunately, even though I am supposed to be "all-knowing", information can very easily be hidden from even me when it comes to video games.
normal:Dari: I do not even know what will happen after you leave this cutscene, or if you have saved my siblings yet.
normal:Dari: But all I do know, is that if you have beaten me, then you are enough of a gamer to blast your way into saving them at least.
normal:Dari: Which means I always had hope in you.

normal:Dari: Alright, I feel it coming soon.
normal:Dari: The end of this cutscene.
normal:Dari: If this is the last time I get to acknowledge you, player, then-
normal:Dari: Then it was an honor, and an incredibly entertaining "fight".
normal:Dari: Well, it was certainly entertaining from MY perspective, anyway.
normal:Dari: I cannot imagine just how truly terrible it might have been for you.
