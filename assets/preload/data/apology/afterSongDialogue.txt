:dari-normal:normal:There, feeling better now, sister?
:sheol-normal:normal:Yeah...  I wave the white-flag...
:sheol-surprise:normal:But I just don’t get it...
:sheol-surprise:normal:I understand that as guests of this universe we’re playing with THEIR rules and that puts US at a disadvantage.
:sheol-surprise:normal:But how did THIS guy beat me in just one try?
:sheol-surprise:loud:He's not even that special??
:sheol-surprise:loud:No offense.
:bf:normal:Bep
:sheol-surprise:normal:I mean, unless...
:sheol-surprise:normal:Unless they're... You know...
:dari-diss:normal:Unless they are cheating...
:sheol-surprise:normal:...
:dari-normal:normal:So you could sense that something was wrong. Good.
:dari-normal:normal:I am glad to see that you are always improving, sis.
:dari-diss:normal:And you, who meddles with the continuity of this universe, even in a space outside of it...
:bf:normal:A?
:dari-normal:normal:Not you, human, if you can even be called that.
:dari-normal:normal:I speak directly to the entity reading my words. Perhaps there are more than one of you?
:dari-normal:normal:Regardless, your ability to freely reset a battle is cheating. Period.
:dari-normal:normal:Even if you TRULY did not use it, the fact that it exists renders any "serious" battle against you worthless, and unfit for the entertainment of my kid sister.
:dari-normal:normal:Just a little hint from me to you, player.
:dari-diss:normal:Do NOT, play the next week.
:dari-normal:normal:If it is even there...
:dari-diss:normal:I will not hold Sheol back. She deserves the relief after all.
:dari-normal:normal:You cheating try-hard, you.
