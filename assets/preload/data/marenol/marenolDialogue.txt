:sheol-true:normal:You...
:sheol-true:normal:You were resetting every time you lost…
:sheol-true:normal:I thought I was just imagining it...
:sheol-true:normal:But now I know it to be true.
:sheol-true:normal:The worst part?
:sheol-true:normal:It’s not even YOUR fault, you strange, blue-haired puppet human.
:sheol-true:normal:You’re just some soulless puppet to be controlled in a game.
:sheol-true:normal:I can’t see you, I can’t even directly interact with you…
:sheol-true:normal:But I know you’re out there.
:sheol-true:normal:Yes, YOU.
:sheol-true:normal:You’re nothing but a cheating try-hard.
:sheol-true:normal:I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. 
:sheol-true:normal:Well, since you can freely retry all you want without any consequences...
:sheol-true:normal:I’m going to make you suffer. 
:sheol-true:normal:Since you find it so fun.
:sheol-true:normal:My siblings can’t get in the way now.
:sheol-true:normal:The only way for you to win is NOT to play.
:sheol-true:normal:From this point onward, know that any suffering you feel, will be your fault.
:sheol-true:normal:You are the one that’s coming back, after all.
