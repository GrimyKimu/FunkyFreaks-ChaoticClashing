normal:???: I am Sain.
normal:Sain: The details need not concern you, player, however-
normal:Sain: You have brought a devastating epiphany upon my precious children, even if it was outside of your control.
normal:Sain: It will be up to you to console them.
normal:Sain: Ah but it won’t be so easy, you see.
normal:Sain: Hmm...
normal:Sain: I am able to create “False” versions of my children, so that you may practice against a simple copy of them.
normal:Sain: Know that practicing against my false copies will not help anyone other than you.
normal:Sain: Unfortunately, that is all that I am currently capable of doing...
normal:Sain: What a conundrum.
normal:Sain: Oh my unfortunate children...

normal:BF: I want to help them.
normal:Sain: Oh?
loud:BF: I said want to help them!
normal:Sain: Oh, now that IS strange.
normal:Sain: Can the puppet make its own choices?

normal:BF: I don't know what the funk is happening, and I don't care!
normal:BF: But if I can help, then I will!
normal:Sain: ...
normal:Sain: From the player's perspective, you, puppet, will only die as many times as they lose while controlling you.
normal:BF: Yeah, and? I already know that. i think
normal:Sain: But from YOUR perspective...
normal:Sain: You will be killed an uncountably infinite amount of times.
normal:Sain: You will be forced to endure an eternity of suffering, infinitely worse than what you have felt in your mortal life.
normal:Sain: And I cannot help you, in ANY way.
normal:Sain: Yet you still want to help my children?
