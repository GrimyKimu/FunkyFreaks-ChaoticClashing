normal:Yes: ...
normal:Sain: ... ...
normal:Sain: Ah, there is a term for this-
normal:Sain: Transgender.
normal:BF: Oh, sweet, free rep points.
normal:Sain: We are all nonbinary entities.
normal:Sain: That is how many of you humans describe it, anyway.
normal:BF: Oh, so you guys DON'T have genders?
normal:BF: I mean, I guess you guys ARE eldtritch beings beyond time and space, or whatever the funk you guys are.
normal:Sain: I guess that is one way to put it.
normal:Sain: But back to Sheol-
normal:Sain: Although born an entity that can be labeled as neither female nor male by default, Sheol decided that Sheol is a she.
normal:Sain: And who are we to deny such a simple dream?
normal:Sain: This creates a fun question-
normal:Sain: Does that make my child transgender? Since she identifies as a gender unlike the one she was born with, which is to say the lack of sex we have.
normal:BF: Fam, I'm pretty sure that is literally just the def of what trans means, lol.
normal:Sain: Ah, I guess so.
normal:Sain: Oh, what am I talking about, you have some dying to do, puppet.
normal:Sain: Please keep having at it, for the sake of my child.
normal:BF: Haha     shit
