loud:yes:...
normal:BF: I gots me a question.
normal:Sain: Ask away.
normal:BF: Like, what are you?
normal:BF: But seriously.
normal:Sain: In a nutshell: Entites that exist beyond your own plane of existance.
normal:Sain: We exist in an infinite number of variations, with varying degrees of control and connection with them.
normal:Sain: You know multiverse theory?
normal:BF: Yeah? Kinda? Every choice makes a new universe or whatever?
normal:Sain: Close.
normal:Sain: With an infinite number of variables, choices, and combinations, we exist in all of them at once.
normal:Sain: Of course, excluding the paradoxes, such as the universes where we simply do not exist.
normal:Sain: This current version of me is extremely aware of my place in this universe-
normal:Sain: However, this version of me also lacks a significant amount of control that I would usually have.
normal:Sain: In, let me say, 99.99% of every possible universe, I am the one in total control.
normal:Sain: Of course, ignoring the paradoxes where the variable is: "Sain has no control".
normal:BF: So in those universes you'd be the big G?
normal:Sain: If I embraced that role, then perhaps.
normal:Sain: Regardless, I have practically no control or power in this form, but still retain my usual all-encompassing knowledge.
normal:Sain: This existance is incredibly painful and horrific.
normal:Sain: But without any control, I do not even get a say in whether or not I continue to live.
normal:BF: Oh...
normal:BF: Sorry...
normal:Sain: Do not apologize, I am glad that this "me" is also completely numb to this pain.
normal:BF: Oof...
normal:Sain: May we continue with the saving of my children, puppet?
normal:BF: Sorry, again...
