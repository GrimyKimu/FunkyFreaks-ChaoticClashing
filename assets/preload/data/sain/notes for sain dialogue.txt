make it so whenever the player attempts to transition into the storyMenu, 
it checks for whether or not a Sain dialogue should begin

During those transitions, also change a few variables in the storyMenu that also help it
determine from what song and which diffs the transitions took place 

E.G. Give the storyMenu info about the song:MARENOL and diff:False, and with that info, load in the right
String Array file, and the proper Sain BG.

That Sain BG will also have the same system as the main menu, where it reacts to what you have and haven't completed yet.
