normal:Sain: How was it? My poor youngest...
normal:Sain: Sheol is a child, even if she IS infinitely older than even you, player.
normal:Sain: The youngest of stars is still magnitudes older than a mere mortal, but in the eyes of the infinite, it is but a young star.
normal:Sain: Ah, I am digressing-
normal:Sain: She is throwing everything she can at you, the only gimmick is the immense pressure of permanently low health and distracting movements.
normal:Sain: I can provide no advice other than for you to practice against her false self, in order to get comfortable with the chart itself, so that you might have a chance against her true self...
normal:Sain: Ah, my sweet child, your freedom will come soon.
normal:Sain: ... ...
normal:Sain: Ah, there is a term for this-
normal:Sain: Transgender.
normal:Sain: We are all nonbinary, asexual, and aromantic, entities.
normal:Sain: That is how many of you humans describe it, anyway.
normal:Sain: However, my sweet Sheol, although born an entity that can be labeled as neither female nor male, has decided that Sheol is a she.
normal:Sain: And who are we to deny such a simple dream?
normal:Sain: This creates a fun question-
normal:Sain: Does that make my child transgender? Since she identifies as a gender not-unlike the one she was born with, which is to say the lack of sex we have.
normal:Sain: Oh, what am I talking about, you have some dying to do.
