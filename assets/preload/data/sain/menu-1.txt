normal:BF: Hey, I know this is an awkward time for all of us, but I have a question.
normal:Sain: Ask away, we have nothing but endless time in this void.
normal:BF: Are ya hot?
normal:BF: I mean, I haven't actually seen what you look like yet, so...?
normal:Sain: As vain as expected.
normal:BF: Hey, I don't appreciate that. I think?
normal:Sain: Our appearances, not just my own but my children as well-
normal:Sain: They are illusions, cast to make looking at us more bearable than usual.
normal:Sain: Well, "illusions" may not be the correct word.
normal:Sain: Projections? Masks?
normal:Sain: Regardless, we have no physicality.
normal:Sain: It is all clever tricks of interaction.
normal:Sain: What may look like us simply picking up an object-
normal:Sain: Is actually us manipulating the very physics of your universe while all at the same time changing the appearance of the mask to make it seem like we are truly there.
normal:BF: That just kinda sounds like having a body but with extra steps.
normal:BF: Like describing how MY body can move and shit, through whatever our brains does to our muscles, or whatever.
normal:BF: Super complicated and boring if you describe every step of the way like that.
normal:Sain: Huh, fair enough.
normal:Sain: And you are correct, whether or not we have true physicality in your universe is hardly important when we can interact with it in anyway we please.
normal:BF: ...
normal:BF: Nerd.
normal:BF: That wasn't even my question anyway.
